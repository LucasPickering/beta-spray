      What is Beta Spray?
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      Beta spray is unsolicited climing advice. That&apos;s bad. Don&apos;t do
      that. <em>Beta Spray</em>, on the other hand, is a site where you can
      update photos of boulder problems and share beta.

      Why?
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      Ever try to share beta over text? It sucks. Now you don&apos;t have to.
      Just upload your problem, send a link and unlock a whole new level of
      spraying potential. Or, maybe you&apos;re &quot;working&quot; from home
      and you can&apos;t stop thinking about your project. Instead of thinking,
      now you&apos;re planning. Snap a photo, upload, and get drawing.
