      Ever try to share beta over text? It sucks. Now you don&apos;t have to.
      Just upload your problem, send a link and unlock a whole new level of
      spraying potential. Or, maybe you&apos;re &quot;working&quot; from home
      and you can&apos;t stop thinking about your project. Instead of thinking,
      now you&apos;re planning. Snap a photo, upload, and get drawing.
    </Typography>
